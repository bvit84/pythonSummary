<p>
    Python is an object oriented programming language.<br>
    Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.<br>
    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

                Objects are <strong>things in memory</strong> that we can refer 
                to by name.<br>
                * We can create objects in memory<br>
                * We can use variable names to refer to objects<br>
                * Objects have a type - and this type tells us what 
                characteristics and behaviors the object can have.<br>
                Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects 
                are functions that belong to the object: 
                NameOfObject.FunctionCall();<br>

                Also all variables in methods for a class are instance-level 
                variables (used for each object).

                , it creates a function object in memory, and sets the name 
                my_function to refer to that object.)<br>

                class className:<br>
                x = 5
            </td>
            <td>
                Creates a class named className, with a property named x.<br>
                >>> MyClass = className() Will create a new object based on the 
                className class, but now it also tells Python that from here 
                forward the name MyClass will refer to that object.<br>
                All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always 
                executed when the class is being initiated, to create an object.<br>
                Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties
                , or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is 
                being created:<br>
                >>> __init__(self, name) will require name variable when calling the 
                class.<br>
                Class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class 
                definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an 
                error.

                Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance 
                of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the 
                class.<br>
                It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you 
                like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the 
                class.

                class Student(Person):<br>
                Python Inheritance<br>
                When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer 
                inherit the parent's __init__() function.<br>
                class Student(Person):<br>
                def __init__(self, fname, lname):<br>
                super().__init__(fname, lname)
            </td>
            <td>
                Python also has a super() function that will make the child class 
                inherit all the methods and properties from its parent.<br>
                By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the 
                parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties 
                from its parent.
            </td>
            <td>
                To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call 
                to the parent's __init__() function:<br>
                class Student(Person):<br>
                def __init__(self, fname, lname):<br>
                Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
            </td>
